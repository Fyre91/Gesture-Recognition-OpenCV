The training images have been removed but the model which was created using the images is present in the Code directory.
Software is written in Qt/C++ integrated with RGB Demo.

RGBDemo is a software to visualize, calibrate and process Kinect output

The code is based on the freenect library http://openkinect.org and
OpenCV http://opencv.willowgarage.com .

The demos are based on a library called nestk. The library itself is
easy to integrate to an existing project using cmake: just copy the
nestk folder as a subfolder of your project and you should be able to
start working with Kinect data. You can get a tutorial to get started
